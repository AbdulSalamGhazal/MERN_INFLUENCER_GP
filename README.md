#This Website is the Graduation project for CS Major, Group 2024

## Project Setup Instructions

This guide will help you set up the dependencies for both the client and server parts of the project, which are located in separate directories in the main project folder.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setting Up the Client

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Change directory to the `client` folder by running:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
4. Install the client dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command reads the `package.json` file in the `client` directory and installs all the necessary dependencies listed there.

## Setting Up the Server

1. Open a new terminal or command prompt window.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project, if you're not already there.
3. Change directory to the `server` folder by running:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
4. Install the server dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Similar to the client setup, this command installs all the dependencies listed in the `server` directory's `package.json` file.

## Running the Project

After installing all dependencies for both client and server, you can start each part of your project according to its respective startup scripts defined in the `package.json` files. Typically, this could be something like `npm start` for both the client and server, but it might vary based on your project's configuration.

For more detailed instructions or troubleshooting, refer to the README files within the `client` and `server` directories, or consult your project's documentation.
